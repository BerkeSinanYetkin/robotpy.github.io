RobotPy is a port of [Python](http://www.python.org/) 3 to the RoboRIO & cRio (obsolete) platforms, intended for use in FRC.  Teams can use this to write their robot code in Python, a powerful dynamic programming language.

Features:

*   Python is simple to learn and easy to maintain.
*   RobotPy lets you reload code without restarting (live reloads).
*   Errors won't crash the robot.
*   RobotPy provides access to WPILib in addition to the Python standard library.
*   No programming software is required; just a text editor!
