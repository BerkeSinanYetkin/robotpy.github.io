RobotPy is a community of FIRST mentors and students dedicated to developing python-related projects for the FIRST Robotics Competition. The primary project we develop is a port of [Python](http://www.python.org/) 3 and WPILib to the RoboRIO & cRio (obsolete) platforms, intended for use in FRC.  Teams can use this to write their robot code in Python, a powerful dynamic programming language.

Features:

*   Python is simple to learn and easy to maintain.
*   RobotPy lets you reload code without restarting (live reloads).
*   RobotPy lets you test and simulate your robot code on your laptop
*   RobotPy provides access to WPILib in addition to the Python standard library.
*   No programming software is required; just a text editor!

To get started, see our [getting started guide](http://robotpy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/getting_started.html) (what else?).
