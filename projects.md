RobotPy is home to several FRC-related python projects:

*   [RobotPy WPILib](https://github.com/robotpy/robotpy-wpilib): the python implementation of WPILib for FRC
*   [pyfrc](https://github.com/robotpy/pyfrc): provides unit testing, realtime robot simulation, and easy upload capabilities for your RobotPy code
*   [robotpy-wpilib-utilities](https://github.com/robotpy/robotpy-wpilib-utilities): Community focused extensions for WPILib

We also maintain python wrappers for several FRC vendor libraries:

*   [robotpy-adi](https://github.com/robotpy/robotpy-adi): wrappers for Analog Devices IMU products 
*   [robotpy-ctre](https://github.com/robotpy/robotpy-ctre): wrappers for the CTRE 3rd party libraries
*   [robotpy-navx](https://github.com/robotpy/robotpy-navx): bindings for the NavX device
*   [robotpy-playingwithfusion](https://github.com/robotpy/robotpy-playingwithfusion): bindings for PWF hardware 
*   [robotpy-rev](https://github.com/robotpy/robotpy-rev): bindings for the REV Robotics SPARK MAX
*   [robotpy-rev-color](https://github.com/robotpy/robotpy-rev-color): wrappers for REV Robotics Color Sensor V3 

RobotPy is home to several python projects that are useful for teams, even if they aren't writing their robot code in python:

*   [pynetworktables](https://github.com/robotpy/pynetworktables): python bindings for NetworkTables that you can use to communcate with SmartDashboard and/or your robot.
*   [pynetworktables2js](https://github.com/robotpy/pynetworktables2js): Forwards NetworkTables traffic to a web page, allowing you to write custom dashboards for your robot using HTML/Javascript
*   [pynetconsole](https://github.com/robotpy/pynetconsole): A simple netconsole implementation in python
*   [roborio-opencv](https://github.com/robotpy/roborio-opencv): OpenCV binaries for RoboRIO
*   [roborio-vm](https://github.com/robotpy/roborio-vm): Scripts to create a QEMU virtual machine from the RoboRIO image file
*   [roborio-docker](https://github.com/robotpy/roborio-docker): Create an ARM docker image from the RoboRIO image file


And, other projects:

*   [RobotPy Eclipse Plugins](https://github.com/robotpy/robotpy-eclipse-plugins) - If you want to develop RobotPy code with Eclipse, we've developed some plugins that provide tight integration with the FRC tools and pyfrc.
*   [robotpy-frcsim](https://github.com/robotpy/robotpy-frcsim): FRCSim/gazebo connection for python code

All RobotPy source code can be found on our [github site](https://github.com/robotpy).
