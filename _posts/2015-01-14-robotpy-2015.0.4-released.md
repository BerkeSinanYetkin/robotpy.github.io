title: RobotPy 2015.0.4 released
---

This is a minor bugfix release of RobotPy, and is an optional upgrade for teams using RobotPy.

* CANJaguar could not be initialized (fixes [issue #120](https://github.com/robotpy/robotpy-wpilib/issues/120))
* CANTalon is now implemented in the simulated HAL, which means you can use it from pyfrc tests and simulations

See all changes on [github](https://github.com/robotpy/robotpy-wpilib/compare/2015.0.3...2015.0.4). You can download the latest release from [github](https://github.com/robotpy/robotpy-wpilib/releases), or use the installer to upgrade your current installation of RobotPy.
