title: PyFRC 2015.3.6 released -- now with real joystick support!
---

The pyfrc simulator now supports using real joysticks as input when you have 
pygame installed for Python 3. If you have pygame installed and a supported
joystick plugged into your computer, pyfrc's simulator will automatically
detect them and feed the joystick input to the simulator.

Because pygame can be tricky to install on some platforms, it has not been added
to the requirements for pyfrc, and pyfrc's simulator will continue to work for
you without pygame or joysticks.

Thanks to [Carter Fendley](https://github.com/CarterFendley) for adding this
support!
