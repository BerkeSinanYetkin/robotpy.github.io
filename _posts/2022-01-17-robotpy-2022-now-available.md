title: RobotPy 2022 now available
---

We’re happy to announce the release of RobotPy for 2022!

* WPILib 2022.2.1 libraries with most features
* Old commands (please stop using it!) and new commands
* All supported vendors -- CTRE, NavX, PWFusion, Rev, Romi

Everything is very lightly tested, and I've only tested the core WPILib
stuff on a roboRIO. Try it out, find a bug, file an issue on github!

Later this season, we will bringing back pytest support for your robot!
I've definitely missed it, and I think I have an approach that will
work (want it to come sooner? Implement [#3867](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/3867) for me!). 

The documentation and examples have not been updated yet. We would love your
help doing that! Please.

Thanks as always to @auscompgeek and @TheTripleV for their help getting this season’s release out.
