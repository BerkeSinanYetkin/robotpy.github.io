title: RobotPy 2017.0.1 critical bugfix release now available
---

robotpy-ctre provides support for the Talon SRX. The install process is a bit
rough and simulation doesn't work in pyfrc yet (someone just needs to take the
time to do it), but I wanted to get this out now so people could try it. We'll
fix the installer and the simulator soon.
