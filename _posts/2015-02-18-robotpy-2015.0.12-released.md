title: Critical RobotPy bug; RobotPy 2015.0.12 released
---

This is a critical bugfix release of RobotPy, and all RobotPy users are recommended to upgrade. We sincerely apologize for releasing this after build season has ended. 

* There was a race condition that could cause the DriverStation thread to crash at startup, and the robot would not respond to driver input, with no notification to the user that this had occurred (other than netconsole output)
* SampleRobot programs now only report readiness to the Driver Station after `robotInit` has finished

See all changes on [github](https://github.com/robotpy/robotpy-wpilib/compare/2015.0.11...2015.0.12). You can download the latest release from [github](https://github.com/robotpy/robotpy-wpilib/releases), or use the installer to upgrade your current installation of RobotPy.
