title: RobotPy Commands V2 now available
---

Sorry for the wait, this was definitely a particularly challenging project to take on! Installation is similar to installing other things this year:

```
pip3 install -U robotpy[commands2]
```

Or on Windows:

```
py -3 -m pip install -U robotpy[commands2]
```

Iâ€™ve done some limited testing on it and it seems to work, but please try it out and let me know if you run into issues!
