title: RobotPy 2019 Release
---

The 2019 release of RobotPy is now available! We had some deployment issues, but everything seems to be up now.

* The core pieces of RobotPy are updated and available (pyfrc, wpilib, cscore, pynetworktables, utilities)
* While we highly recommend using vscode for python development, we have not deployed the robotpy vscode plugin to the vscode marketplace yet. Hopefully later this week. 
* Pathfinder v2 is not available yet, so there are no RobotPy bindings for them. Pathfinder v1 should continue to work.
* NavX support is now in its own library (robotpy-navx), and has been updated for 2019
* The CTRE bindings have not been updated for 2019, but I'll work on those tonight and I expect them to be available later this weekend
* No new motor controller bindings have been created *yet* this year. If you are interested in seeing them available, please comment and we'll see what we can do (though, this is labor-intensive and we could use more help with this!)

If you run into issues, please let us know or file a bug on github! Get the latest release at https://github.com/robotpy/robotpy-wpilib/releases
