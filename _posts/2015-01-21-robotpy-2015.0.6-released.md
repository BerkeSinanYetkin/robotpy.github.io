title: RobotPy 2015.0.6 released

This is a critical bugfix release of RobotPy, and this update is recommended for all RobotPy users.

* NetworkTables didn't properly handle sequence numbers, and would crash the server thread if too many values were sent over the network. This could lead to dangerous situations if test mode/LiveWindow were enabled.
* CANJaguar update
