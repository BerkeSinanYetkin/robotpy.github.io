title: RobotPy support moving to gitter!
---

As some of you may be aware, for a number of years we've had an official IRC channel for RobotPy. However, IRC is a bit obscure and isn't always the friendliest to beginners, so I'm switching the official robotpy support channel to use gitter instead.

If you're interested in helping with the ongoing RobotPy 2017 WPILib updates, please join the room to find out how you can contribute!
