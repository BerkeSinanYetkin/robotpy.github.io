If you're just trying to view the images from a camera, this can be a great solution. The stream is embeddable in a webpage, so it integrates well with a [pynetworktables2js](https://github.com/robotpy/pynetworktables2js) dashboard. Includes an init script that automatically starts mjpg-streamer when the robot starts, and you can edit the settings pretty easily too.

* Installation: https://github.com/robotpy/roborio-packages
* Notes: https://github.com/robotpy/roborio-packages/tree/2016/ipkg/mjpg-streamer
