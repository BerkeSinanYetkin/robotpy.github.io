title: pyfrc 2015.0.1 released
---

The following bugs were fixed:

* Code deployment failed when running on Windows ([issue #11](https://github.com/robotpy/pyfrc/issues/11))
* When running tests during deployment, the test directory would be deployed instead of the code directory

The following features were added:

* ``--nc`` option has been added to show netconsole output after deployment, so you don't have to start a separate netconsole listener

All users of pyfrc are encouraged to upgrade.
