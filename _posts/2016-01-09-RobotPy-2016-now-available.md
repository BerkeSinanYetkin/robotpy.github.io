title: 2016 RobotPy now available!
---

We're happy to announce the initial release of RobotPy for the 2016 season. This release contains most of the new changes for WPILib in 2016, with the notable exception of some new CANTalon functionality (but we hope to get that updated within the next week or so). Here's some things that we have available for 2016:

* RobotPy 2016.0.0
	* Python 3.5.1 interpreter for RoboRIO
	* WPILib/HAL packages for RoboRIO
	* [pynetworktables](https://github.com/robotpy/pynetworktables) and [robotpy-wpilib-utilities](https://github.com/robotpy/robotpy-wpilib-utilities)
* pyfrc 2016.1.0

Additionally, the following packages are available through our opkg feed:

* OpenCV 3.1.0 (C++, Java, and Python bindings)
* NumPy 1.10.2

Some things that you can look forward to in the future:

* ipk Packaging for mjpg-streamer
* robotpy-websim
* pynetworktables upgrades

The RoboRIO binaries will only work correctly on a RoboRIO that has been reimaged for the 2016 season.

Our initial RobotPy release for 2016 is now available for download on our [release page](https://github.com/robotpy/robotpy-wpilib/releases).

A lot of work has been put into this release, and we're really excited about the upcoming season! Special thanks to Christian Balcom and James Ward for their contributions.

We expect there to be some bugs at first as teams start playing with their new toys, so please [report them on our issue tracker](https://github.com/robotpy/robotpy-wpilib/issues) as you find them!
