title: RobotPy 2023 is now available
---

We're happy to announce the release of RobotPy for 2023! Just `pip3 install robotpy`
and you're off and running! Well, read the install guide.

* All WPILib 2023.1.1 features are available
* Commands v1 is gone (yay) but Commands v2 is available
* CTRE, PWFusion, REV vendors are available
* robotpy-cscore has wheels now for desktop platforms, which makes it much easier to install
* robotpy-apriltag is a thing now, check it out
* pyntcore no longer requires pynetworktables and replaces it. Lots of API changes here because of NT4
* Our examples repository has a lot more examples! Thanks especially to @BerkeSinanYetkin and @mrguisamuel

Python is not an official FRC language yet, but we are working with the WPILib team to make it official in 2024. See https://wpilib.org/blog/bringing-python-to-frc for the announcement.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to this release!
