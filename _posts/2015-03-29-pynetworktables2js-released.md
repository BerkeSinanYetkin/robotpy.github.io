title: pynetworktables2js 2015.1.0 released
---

Team 1418 and the RobotPy project are happy to announce the release of pynetworktables2js, a cross platform library that forwards NetworkTables key/values to a webpage, so that you can easily write a Driver Station Dashboard for your robot in HTML5 + JavaScript.

Because the communications layer uses NetworkTables, you can connect your web interface to all FRC languages (C++, Java, LabVIEW, Python).

The original working prototype for pynetworktables2js was originally created by 1418 student [Leon Tan](https://github.com/lleontan), and I've polished it and turned it into something that other teams can use. Team 1418 won an Innovation In Control award this weekend at the Greater DC regional, in part because of our shiny+functional HTML dashboard (look for a source code release soon!).

Lots of students and mentors know how to create simple web pages to display content, and there's lots of resources out there for creating dynamic content for webpages that use javascript. There is a lot of visually appealing content that others have created using web technologies -- why not leverage those resources to make something cool to control your robot?
