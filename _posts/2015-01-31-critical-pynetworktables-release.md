title: Hopefully the last critical pynetworktables bugfix release; RobotPy 2015.0.8 released
---

I spent a week looking really closely at pynetworktables, and as a result pynetworktables 2015.1.0 has been released, which fixes a number of critical bugs which may cause your robot to freeze/deadlock or have poor performance on poorly performing networks. See [https://github.com/robotpy/pynetworktables/pull/11](https://github.com/robotpy/pynetworktables/pull/11) for more information.

RobotPy has been updated to 2015.0.8, and is a recommended update for all RobotPy users.

* Update pynetworktables dependency
* Minor simulator related clarified error messages
