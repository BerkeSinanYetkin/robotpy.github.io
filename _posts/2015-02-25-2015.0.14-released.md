title: RobotPy 2015.0.14 released
---

This is a bugfix release of RobotPy, but teams are strongly encouraged to upgrade.

* When HAL functions that use a status return a warning, warnings.warn is called instead of throwing an exception. This problem has been most observed when using the PDP, but in theory it could happen in other locations (see https://github.com/robotpy/robotpy-wpilib/issues/143)
* Updates to the simulated HAL
