title: PyFRC 2015.3.4 released
---

Contains some physics related and CANTalon bugfixes. Speaking of which, pyfrc has physics support again, which means you can run your robot on a simulated field again! It's pretty useful for testing out autonomous modes and some other limited behaviors. Check out the [pyfrc documentation](http://pyfrc.readthedocs.org/en/latest/simulator.html#module-pyfrc.physics.core) for more details!

As before, there are samples distributed with pyfrc that show you how you can take advantage of this really cool functionality that puts python a step above the rest for FRC programming!
